# BTK Akademi Application

#### This is a simple application that allows the user to apply for courses listed on the Apply section.

## Structure And How it works !

### Home
![Home Page](/Images_Captures/Home_Page.PNG)

As you can see this home page contains a button that allows user to redirect to "Apply" Page
In the navigation bar you can also go to the Apply Page by clicking on Apply

### Apply

### FeedBack
![FeedBack Page](/Images_Captures/FeedBack.PNG)
This page displays the feedback to user. It displays the name of the user, the course name and date + time of the application.
### Applications
![Application Page](/Images_Captures/Applications.PNG)
And now we go to the Application Page through Applications, we can see the number of applications. For now there is only one user who apply for these courses.

### Apply Page Again
The form application requires an email-address that you can use only one time, even if we would like to apply the second time but for an other course.
You can see if i try to apply again with the same email, it returns the message that is in the red color!
